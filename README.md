First of all, you have to loh in if you want to acess to the App.

Logging in is very easy, you only need to write down your name and your password. If one of them are incorrect,
an error message will be shown.

The user's name and password registered in the system are saved in a .txt file, when an user wants to log in, the program reads the .txt
file and searchs for the name and password.

If you have not a user registered, you can create a new one by pressing the buttom "Registrarse".

</p>

</p>

In the payment page, the user can see the sum with the final price. The sum are generated by all the prices of all products that have been chosen by the customer and are loaded in a .txt file.

There is a big difference among the .txt used to save the users registered and the other two used to saved the food and the drink registrations: the first one save the information even when the program is closed and loaded when an user want to log in, however, the data on the.txt files used to order food/drink is deleted once the programe is close, so the new user has no access to the other users orders.

By pressing "Mostrar" the final price will be shown and by pressing "Pagar", the payment will be done.

However, there is a possibility the user has not choosen a payment method yet. At the left of the page, inside a shield, there is a button that allows the users to
chose a method payment.
